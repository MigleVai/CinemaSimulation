C# Applied object-oriented programming

This is my second project with C#. It's kind of badly written, I don't like now (after half of year) how I wrote majority of the code. But I don't want to return to this project because we had to recreate our Java projects and I did not like that one too. The reason being that Java project was too long and we had to do it half a year by adding new features and in C# task we had to do the most random requirements ever (http://uosis.mif.vu.lt/~vytautasa/TOP/ second task). So it took more time thinking how on earth I could implement them, than me enjoying programming which in my opinion is not really nice.
